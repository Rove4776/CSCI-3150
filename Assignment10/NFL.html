            <h2> Power Rankings</h2>
            <p><p>
    The Buffalo Bills, Kansas City Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles, all show the most promise currently.

    <h2>
    The Buffalo Bills
    </h2>
    
    <p>
    The Buffalo Bills have shown continual success, as Josh Allen is playing at an MVP level. This team seems to show no holes at any position.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
    The Kansas City Chiefs
    </h2>
    
    <p>
    The Kansas City Chiefs have shown continual success for almost the last 6-7 years. Mahomes shows he is an MVP caliber player, and his roster continues to compliment him. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>
    Philadelphia Eagles
    </h2>
    
    <p>
    The Philadelphia Eagles are a surprise to many, but their GM Howie Roseman gave the roster the needed makeover in the off season. From adding AJ Brown ffor Jalen hurts, to adding almost 8-9 defensive stars through trades, free agency, and the draft. Combine this with Hurts stellar level of play, he is making the right strides in making the MVP conversation. This team is definetly a roster I am excited to see come January.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The three teams listed in detail, have very minimal injuries, as well as the strongest rosters. This is why I placed them as favorites in terms of making the post season.
